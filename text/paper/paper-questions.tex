\section{Research questions}
The research question of this proposal is:

What are the steps required to distribute a verified implementation of an algorithm on a GPU-cluster?

A possible division in subquestions is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can the algorithm be divided in separate processes?
    \item How can the algorithm be run on multiple devices using MPI?
    \item How can the verification of the implementation be guaranteed?
    \item What is the optimal number of GPUs when considering cost, efficiency, and the amount of data compared?
\end{enumerate}
