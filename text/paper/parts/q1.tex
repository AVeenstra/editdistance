\section{Dividing the algorithm}
The algorithm de Heus uses a dynamic programming solution\cite{Heus}.
In his paper he describes a way to distribute the computation on multiple work-groups of a GPU.
The dynamic programming algorithm fills a matrix with the following rules\cite{Jordan}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
H_{(-1,j)} & = j \\
H_{(i,-1)} & = i \\
H_{(i,j)} & = \min \begin{cases}
          \operatorname{H}_{(i-1,j)} + 1 \\
          \operatorname{H}_{(i,j-1)} + 1 \\
          \operatorname{H}_{(i-1,j-1)} + Score
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $Score$ is zero if the characters of the compared sequences at index $i$ and $j$ are equal; otherwise, the $Score$ is one.

The value of $H_{(i,j)}$ depends on the cells $H_{(i-1,j)}$, $H_{(i,j-1)}$, and $H_{(i-1,j-1)}$.
This limits the use of parallelism to speed up the computation, but it leaves an opening none the less.
There is no dependency between cells $H_{(a,b)}$ if $a + b$ is constant.
The grey cells in table \ref{diagonal} are such a group of cells which can be calculated in parallel.
Each diagonal is based on the previous two diagonals, because of the dependencies previously mentioned\cite{Meyers}.
There is no need to save diagonals prior to those two diagonals, so the implementation can discard the previous diagonals to save memory.

With larger sequences the diagonal becomes too large to calculate in one iteration on a GPU.
Dividing the matrix vertically allows one to split the calculation in manageable parts.
Each part requires the right most column of the previous part due to the dependencies of each cell.
This means the other columns can be discarded to save memory.

Each of the parts mentioned above can be split in blocks.
Blocks $A$ to $C$ and $D$ to $F$ in table \ref{division} are such a partitioning.
The dependencies of the individual cells are inherited by the individual blocks.
Just like the cells the blocks can also be calculated in parallel if they are not dependent of one another.
Block $D$ and $c$ are such blocks as they only require block $B$.
With larger sequences the number of independent blocks becomes more significant.
As a result the calculation of multiple blocks in parallel becomes more attractive.

Blocks $B$ and $E$ are constructed diagonally to optimise the amount of threads at work at any given time.
If the blocks where squares \todo{finish this}
