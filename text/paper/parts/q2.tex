\section{Using MPI}
Now that the algorithm is split in manageable parts in \fref{section}{q1} the next step is to distribute the algorithm over a cluster.
MPI offers various functions to simplify the distribution, but the main focus will be on exchanging the columns as explained in \fref{section}{partitioning}.
How the tasks will be divided is the first problem that will be tackled.
