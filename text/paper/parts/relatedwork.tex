\subsection{Edit distance problem on GPU}
As mentioned before, the edit distance problem has already been implemented on a single GPU \cite{Heus}.
His implementation also uses the Levenshtein distance.
This implementation will be used as base in \cref{originalalg}.
The new implementation could be compared to this single node implementation to calculate the difference in time required to compute the edit distance of two strings.

\subsection{Benchmark on a GPU cluster}
This is an MPI-OpenCL implementation of the LINPACK benchmark which was run on a cluster containing 49 nodes, each node containing two eight-core CPUs and four GPUs \cite{Cluster}.
Their implementation achieves 93.69 Tflops, which is 46 percent of the theoretical peak.
It shows a successful implementation of MPI in combination with OpenCL, which is required in the implementation of the edit distance algorithm.
