\subsection{Edit distance problem on GPU}
As mentioned before the edit distance problem has already been implemented on a single GPU \cite{Heus}.
This implementation also uses the operations insert, delete, and replace.
This implementation will be improved if necessary and will probably be the base of the future implementation.
The result of this project could be compared to this single node implementation to calculate the difference in time required to compute the edit distance of two strings.

\subsection{Benchmark on a GPU-cluster}
This is an MPI-OpenCL implementation of the LINPACK benchmark which was run on a cluster containing 49 nodes, each node containing two eight-core CPUs and four GPUs \cite{Cluster}.
The implementation achieves 93.69 Tflops, which is 46 percent of the theoretical peak.
It shows a successful implementation of MPI in combination with OpenCL, which is required in the future implementation of the edit distance algorithm.
